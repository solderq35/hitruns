## The Clouds Burst

When the level starts, head forward and into the goblin arena. From here, we can actually skip 2 fights in a row:

Now head through all of the goblins and enter the next arena, where you'll find Lianna fending off several goblins. Run by her and climb up the ladder to the right, where you can do a cool strat to knock down the barrel early:

Once the barrel's been knocked down, continue forward across the water. (Don't get knocked off by the goblins!) Trigger Beorn's cutscene, then climb the chain to the left and continue along the path.

Another cutscene will trigger, with Beorn killing a goblin. Immediately after this cutscene, we'll be doing our next skip, which involves a fairly precise rock throw:

Hitting the barrel causes you to warp across the bridge, where you can do one final out-of-bounds trick to finish off the level (and the game!).
