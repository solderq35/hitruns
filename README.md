<h2 align="center">HitRuns</h2>

This is a mirror for the [Hitman 3 speedrun.com leaderboard](https://www.speedrun.com/hitman_3). It is intended as a backup and/or supplement to the speedrun.com leaderboards, not as a replacement. Backups of important Hitman 3 leaderboards will be hosted here, as will guides.

I mostly based the structure of this site from [milankarman's Hobbit Speedruns site](https://github.com/milankarman/HobbitSpeedruns). You can follow the site in progress at [the HitRuns website](https://hitruns.vercel.app/), as well as in this Github respository. I'm pretty amateur at coding and the original Hobbit Speedruns site wasn't designed to host leaderboards from a ton of categories, so excuse the poorly optimized code.
