<h2 align="center">HitRuns</h2>

### About
This is a mirror for the [Hitman 3 speedrun.com leaderboard](https://www.speedrun.com/hitman_3). It is intended as a backup and/or supplement to the speedrun.com leaderboards, not as a replacement. Backups of important Hitman 3 leaderboards will be hosted here, as will guides.

I mostly based the structure of this site from [milankarman's Hobbit Speedruns site](https://github.com/milankarman/HobbitSpeedruns). You can follow the site in progress at [the HitRuns website](https://hitruns.vercel.app/), as well as in this Github respository. I'm pretty amateur at coding and the original Hobbit Speedruns site wasn't designed to host leaderboards from a ton of categories, so excuse the poorly optimized code.


### Setup and Startup

Clone the project using `git clone` command like so:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/solderq35/hitruns.git
```

Navigate into the repository folder and install the project's dependecies using this command:

```sh
yarn install
```

When the dependencies are done installing run the development server with the following command:

```sh
yarn dev
```

The project is now up and running on port 3000.
